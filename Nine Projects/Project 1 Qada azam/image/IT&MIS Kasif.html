          <h1>Missle Man Of India</h1>
          <p>
           <b> Research in missile technology resumed again</b> after India's
            independence along with the weapons of mass destruction. Development
            of nuclear weapons was followed by various missile programs in 70s
            with development of various ballistic, cruise, surface to air, anti-
            ballistic missile and orbital launch systems. India conducted its
            first nuclear test and initiated with Project Devil as an attempt to
            reverse engineer Soviet surface to air missile SA-2 Guideline and
            Project Valiant to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile.
            However, it could not succeed and experience gained led to
            development of Prithvi series of short range
            ballistic-missiles.[2][3] In early 80s, India conducted its first
            successful orbital launch[4] and synchronized its research
            institutions under IGMDP and successfully developed a series of
            strategic missile systems.[5] The project began in early 1980s and
            ended in 2008, after these strategic missiles were successfully
            developed. The last major missile developed under the program was
            the Agni 3 intermediate-range ballistic missile which was
            successfully tested on 9 July 2007. Since then, India has developed,
            tested, operationalized, and is developing several missile systems
            that are limited to only a handful of countries including ICBMs,
            ASATs, SLBMs and hypersonic weapon systems. Threats posed by enemy
            missile systems led to the pursuit of Indian Ballistic Missile
            Defense Programme.
