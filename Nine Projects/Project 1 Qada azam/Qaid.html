          <h1>Missle Man Of Pakistan</h1>
          <p>
            Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister
            at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he
            enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national
            politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose
            to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two
            decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political
            career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the
            1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim
            League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a
            key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a
            fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political
            rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however,
            Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a
            campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.By
            1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the
            subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible
            marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim
            state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the
            Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims.
            During the Second World War, the League gained strength while
            leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial
            elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats
            reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League
            could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the
            entirety of British India to be united as a single state following
            independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the
            independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a
            Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.
